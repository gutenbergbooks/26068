<h2>TERMS AND DIRECTIONS.</h2>


<div class="hang1"><i>A Loop</i>, written L; <i>2 Loops</i>, written 2 L, and so on.<br /><br /></div>

<div class='hang1'><i>Single stitches</i>&mdash;Are formed in two ways: First, by letting the
thread of the shuttle with which you are working fall over
the back of the hand and pushing the shuttle from you.
Secondly, by letting the thread of the shuttle with which
you are working fall over the palm of the hand, and putting
the shuttle through <i>towards</i> you. These two stitches
worked together alternately make a <i>Double stitch</i>. But if
the second be worked first and the first second, alternately,
it makes a <i>Reversed Double</i>. This is used for the purpose
of making all the work have a right and wrong side.<br /><br /></div>

<div class='hang1'><i>2 Threads</i>&mdash;When 2 threads are used, twist the one with which
the stitches are to be made round the little finger, and
proceed as above.<br /><br /></div>

<div class='hang1'><i>Double stitch</i>, written D; <i>2 Double stitches</i>, written 2 D, &amp;c.<br /><br /></div>

<div class='hang1'><i>Reversed Double stitch</i>, written R D; <i>2 Reversed Double stitches</i>,
written 2 R D, &amp;c.<br /><br /></div>

<div class='hang1'><i>Loops</i>&mdash;Are made by putting the thread with which double stitches
are made over a pin, and there must be <i>one</i> or more <i>Double
stitches</i> between each loop. By holding the pin point
towards the right hand, between the forefinger and thumb
of the left, the thread can be lifted over by the 2nd finger
of the right hand, and many loops made without removing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
it. With reversed double stitches, the thread is lifted over
by the shuttle as the 2nd stitch is being made. Loops can
also be made by putting the shuttle thread over the pin.<br /><br /></div>

<div class='hang1'><i>Ovals</i>&mdash;Form the cotton of the shuttle you are directed to work
with into a loop round the hand, and begin working the
stitches. If composed of double stitches only (with perhaps
one loop in the centre), it is called a <i>plain oval</i>. If of
several loops, a <i>looped oval</i>.<br /><br /></div>

<div class='hang1'><i>A Join</i>&mdash;Is always made by drawing the thread with which the
stitches are worked through the specified loop or space, and
passing the shuttle through the loop formed by the thread
thus drawn through, making it equal in length to an
ordinary loop. To make a join, 2 threads or an oval are
necessary.<br /><br /></div>

<div class='hang1'><i>To Tie</i>&mdash;This is done by drawing the thread on the shuttle with
which you are working through the specified loop or space
(or round some thread), and putting the same shuttle through
the loop so formed, always drawing it <i>quite</i> tight. It may
sometimes be necessary to do this with the other thread;
but it is done in the same way, with <i>one</i> thread <i>only</i>, and
always drawn quite tight.<br /><br /></div>

<div class='hang1'><i>To Attach</i>&mdash;Proceed as in tying&mdash;only pass the shuttle round the
<i>second thread</i> before putting it through the loop, and drawing
tight. This ties in the <i>second thread</i>, which cannot be
so securely done by ordinary joining.<br /><br /></div>
